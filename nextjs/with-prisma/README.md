## Key Features

- **üîí Security First:** Runs the application as a non-root user (`nextjs`) to minimize security risks.
- **üß© Modular & Extensible:** Uses a script-based startup system. Simply add or remove shell scripts in the `/scripts` directory to customize the startup sequence.
- **‚ö° Optimized for Production:** Built with multi-stage builds to create a small and efficient final image.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Flexible Package Manager:** Supports `pnpm`, `yarn`, and `npm` out of the box.
- **üîÑ Built-in Revalidation:** Includes a mechanism to automatically revalidate Next.js pages on startup.
- **üóÉÔ∏è Prisma Ready:** Automatically runs database migrations (`prisma migrate deploy`) during the startup sequence.

## Prerequisites

To use this Docker image, you will need the following tools installed on your local machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (recommended for local development)

## How to Use in Your Project

Integrating this base image into your Next.js project is straightforward.

### 1. Create a `Dockerfile`

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your Next.js project with the following content. The base image handles all the heavy lifting.

```docker
# Use the desired version tag. Using 'latest' is convenient but pinning to a specific version is safer for production.
FROM ghcr.io/gecut/nextjs/with-prisma:latest

# Copy your application code into the image.
# The base image knows where to put it.
COPY . .
```

### 2. Build Your Image

Open your terminal and run the build command:

```bash
docker build -t my-awesome-next-app .
```

**To use a different package manager (default is `pnpm`):**

```bash
# For Yarn
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_MANAGER=yarn -t my-awesome-next-app .

# For NPM
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm -t my-awesome-next-app .
```

### 3. Run the Container

The easiest way to run the container is with `docker-compose`.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    # Use the image you just built
    image: my-awesome-next-app
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      # See the Configuration section for all available variables
      - PORT=3000
      - REVALIDATE_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN
      - UPLOADS_STORAGE_PATH=/app/public/uploads
    volumes:
      # Persist uploaded files by mounting a volume
      - ./public/uploads:/app/public/uploads
```

Then, start your application:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Configuration

The behavior of the startup scripts can be controlled via these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | The port the Next.js server will listen on. | `3000` |
| `REVALIDATE_SECRET` | A secret token used to secure the `/api/revalidate` endpoint. If not set, revalidation is skipped. | (none) |
| `*_STORAGE_PATH` | Any variable ending with this suffix will be treated as a path whose permissions need to be fixed for the `nextjs` user. | (none) |
| `ORIGIN` | The base URL for the revalidation request (e.g., your production domain). | `http://localhost:3000`|

## Architectural Philosophy

1.  **Orchestrator Pattern (`setup.sh`)**: The main `setup.sh` script acts as an orchestrator that simply executes every `*.sh` file within the `/scripts` directory in numerical/alphabetical order.
2.  **Modular Startup (`/scripts` directory)**: Every distinct startup task (fixing permissions, running migrations) is isolated in its own script for clarity, extensibility, and maintainability.
3.  **Security through Privilege Separation**: The container starts as `root` to perform setup tasks, but the final script (`99-entrypoint.sh`) uses `su-exec` to drop privileges and execute the application as the unprivileged `nextjs` user.

## Development Guide

This section is for those who want to contribute to or modify this base image project itself.

### File Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile          # The core Docker multi-stage build instructions.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh            # The root orchestrator script (the main ENTRYPOINT).
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10-fix-permission.sh  # Fixes storage path permissions.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20-prisma-migrate.sh  # Runs Prisma migrations.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 30-revalidate.sh      # Triggers Next.js revalidation in the background.
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 99-entrypoint.sh      # The final script that starts the Node.js process.
```

### How to Add a New Startup Task

1.  Create a new shell script in the `scripts/` directory.
2.  Name it with a number reflecting its execution order (e.g., `25-my-task.sh`).
3.  Write your task logic. If you need to run a command as the `nextjs` user, use `su-exec nextjs <your-command>`.
4.  Make the script executable (`chmod +x`). The orchestrator will automatically pick it up.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in the Dockerfile.
- [ ] Add support for graceful shutdowns within the application process.
- [ ] Create more script examples for common use-cases.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why does the revalidation script wait for 5 seconds?**
**A:** This delay gives the Next.js server enough time to fully start up and be ready to accept HTTP requests. Without it, the `curl` command might fail because it tries to connect to a server that isn't running yet.

**Q: Can I run custom commands before the application starts?**
**A:** Yes! That's the primary benefit of this architecture. Simply create a new script in the `scripts/` directory with the desired execution number, and it will run automatically.
